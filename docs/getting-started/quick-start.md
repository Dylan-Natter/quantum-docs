# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Quantum Platform! This guide will help you get up and running in just a few minutes.

## What You'll Build

In this quick start, you'll:
1. Set up your development environment
2. Create your first intent
3. Execute a simple workflow
4. Monitor the results

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **Node.js** 18+ installed
- **Python** 3.10+ installed
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
- **Git** installed

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/centrex-ai/quantum-platform.git
cd quantum-platform
```

## Step 2: Start the Development Environment

The Quantum Platform includes a complete local development environment with all necessary services.

```bash
# Start all services
make up

# Wait for services to be ready
sleep 10

# Check service status
docker compose -f infra/local/docker-compose.yml ps
```

You should see:
- **PostgreSQL** running on port 5432
- **Redis** running on port 6379
- **API Gateway** running on port 8000
- **Web Application** running on port 3000

## Step 3: Access the Platform

Open your browser and navigate to:
- **Web Application**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **API Documentation**: [http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs)

## Step 4: Create Your First Intent

Let's create a simple intent that sends a welcome email to new users.

### Using the Web Interface

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Click "Create Intent"
3. Fill in the intent details:
   - **Name**: `welcome-email`
   - **Description**: `Send welcome email to new users`
4. Define the workflow steps:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "workflow",
     "description": "Send welcome email to new users",
     "steps": [
       {
         "id": "send-welcome-email",
         "module": "email-service",
         "parameters": {
           "to": "{{user.email}}",
           "subject": "Welcome to Quantum Platform!",
           "template": "welcome",
           "data": {
             "name": "{{user.name}}",
             "platform": "Quantum Platform"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
5. Click "Save Intent"

### Using the API

```bash
# Create intent via API
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/intents" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  -d '{
    "name": "welcome-email",
    "definition": {
      "type": "workflow",
      "description": "Send welcome email to new users",
      "steps": [
        {
          "id": "send-welcome-email",
          "module": "email-service",
          "parameters": {
            "to": "{{user.email}}",
            "subject": "Welcome to Quantum Platform!",
            "template": "welcome",
            "data": {
              "name": "{{user.name}}",
              "platform": "Quantum Platform"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

## Step 5: Execute the Workflow

Now let's execute the intent with some test data.

### Using the Web Interface

1. Navigate to the "Workflows" section
2. Click "Execute Workflow"
3. Select the `welcome-email` intent
4. Provide test data:
   ```json
   {
     "user": {
       "email": "john@example.com",
       "name": "John Doe"
     }
   }
   ```
5. Click "Execute"

### Using the API

```bash
# Execute workflow via API
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/workflows" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  -d '{
    "intent_id": "your-intent-id",
    "parameters": {
      "user": {
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "name": "John Doe"
      }
    }
  }'
```

## Step 6: Monitor the Execution

### Using the Web Interface

1. Navigate to the "Workflows" section
2. Find your workflow execution
3. Click on it to see detailed execution steps
4. Monitor the progress in real-time

### Using the API

```bash
# Get workflow status
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/workflows/your-workflow-id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token"
```
