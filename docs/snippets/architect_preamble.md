# Architect Preamble

## Context
This document provides the foundational context for architectural decisions and system design within the Quantum Platform. All architectural work should reference and build upon these principles.

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Intent-Driven Architecture
Every system component must be traceable to an explicit business intent. This ensures:
- Clear business justification for all changes
- Proper impact analysis and testing
- Compliance with regulatory requirements
- Maintainable and auditable codebase

### 2. Multi-Tenant Security Model
The platform enforces strict tenant isolation through multiple layers:
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level tenant isolation
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Fine-grained authorization
- **Intent Registry Service (IRS) Gates**: Tenant boundary enforcement
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: No implicit trust between services

### 3. Cloud-Native Design
All components are designed for cloud deployment:
- Containerized microservices
- Event-driven architecture
- Auto-scaling and self-healing
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### 4. Security by Design
Security is integrated into every layer:
- Authentication and authorization at all entry points
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Regular security scanning and updates

## Architectural Constraints

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI, Go for high-performance services
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with modern tooling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS
- **Message Queue**: Azure Event Hubs
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage
- **Container Registry**: Azure Container Registry
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (AKS)

### Performance Requirements
- API response time: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- System uptime: 99.9% SLA
- Concurrent users: 10,000+ per tenant
- Data processing: Real-time event processing

### Compliance Requirements
- GDPR compliance for EU data
- SOC 2 Type II controls
- Regular security audits
- Data retention policies

## Design Patterns

### Service Communication
- Event-driven communication for loose coupling
- API-first design with OpenAPI specifications
- Circuit breaker patterns for resilience
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Data Management
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- CQRS for read/write separation
- Database per tenant for strict isolation
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Security Patterns
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

## Quality Attributes

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of stateless services
- Database sharding strategies
- Caching layers for performance
- Load balancing and auto-scaling

### Reliability
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Bulkhead isolation
- Graceful degradation
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### Maintainability
- Modular architecture with clear boundaries
- Comprehensive documentation
- Automated testing at all levels
- Continuous integration and deployment

### Security
- Defense in depth
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular security assessments
- Incident response procedures

## Decision Framework

When making architectural decisions, consider:
1. **Impact on tenant isolation**: Does this change affect multi-tenancy?
2. **Security implications**: What are the security risks and mitigations?
3. **Performance impact**: How does this affect system performance?
4. **Maintainability**: How does this affect long-term maintenance?
5. **Compliance**: Does this meet regulatory requirements?
