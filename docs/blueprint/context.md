# Quantum Platform Blueprint Context

## Overview

The Quantum Platform is a multi-tenant, intent-driven orchestration system designed for enterprise-scale deployment on Azure. This blueprint defines the architecture, patterns, and guardrails for building and operating the platform.

## Core Principles

### 1. Intent-Driven Architecture
- All system behavior is driven by explicit intent declarations
- Intent references (`intent_ref`) must be present in all source code
- Intent registry maintains the source of truth for system behavior

### 2. Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Strict tenant isolation enforced at all layers
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for data isolation
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for authorization
- IRS (Intent Registry Service) gates for tenant boundary enforcement

### 3. Zero-Trust Security
- All communications are authenticated and authorized
- No implicit trust between services
- Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring

### 4. Cloud-Native Design
- Containerized microservices
- Event-driven architecture
- Auto-scaling and self-healing capabilities
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Architecture Components

### Core Services
- **Gateway**: API gateway with authentication and routing
- **Control Plane**: Tenant and resource management
- **Intent Registry**: Intent storage and versioning
- **Orchestrator**: Intent execution and workflow management
- **Module Services**: Domain-specific business logic

### Supporting Services
- **Identity Service**: Authentication and authorization
- **Event Hub**: Asynchronous messaging
- **Storage**: Blob storage for artifacts and data
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS for tenant isolation
- **Monitoring**: Observability and alerting

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI, Go for high-performance services
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with modern tooling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS
- **Message Queue**: Azure Event Hubs
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage
- **Container Registry**: Azure Container Registry
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (AKS)
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Azure CLI

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- All source files must include `intent_ref` header
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Automated linting and formatting
- Security scanning in CI/CD

### Documentation
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant changes
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Runbooks for operational procedures

### Deployment
- Blue-green deployments
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Environment promotion pipeline

## Compliance and Governance

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance for EU data
- SOC 2 Type II controls
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits

### Operational Excellence
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) < 15 minutes
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Regular disaster recovery testing

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: < 200ms API response time (95th percentile)
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Developer Experience**: < 5 minute local development setup
- **Compliance**: 100% audit findings addressed
