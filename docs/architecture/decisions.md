# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This document contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Quantum Platform. ADRs capture important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## ADR Template

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by this change?

## ADR Index

## ADR Details

### ADR-0001: Use Async PostgreSQL Driver

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-04  
**Decision Owner**: Application Architect

#### Context
The Quantum Platform requires high-performance database operations with support for concurrent requests. The initial implementation was experiencing hanging commands due to synchronous database drivers conflicting with async application architecture.

#### Decision
Use `asyncpg` as the PostgreSQL driver instead of `psycopg2` for all database operations. Configure Alembic to work with async engines using `async_engine_from_config`.

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Eliminates command hanging issues
- Better performance for concurrent database operations
- Consistent async/await patterns throughout the application
- Better resource utilization

**Negative**:
- Requires async/await patterns in all database code
- Alembic configuration is more complex
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with async Python

**Risks**:
- Migration complexity if switching drivers later
- Potential performance issues if not properly configured

### ADR-0002: FastAPI for API Gateway

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-04  
**Decision Owner**: Application Architect

#### Context
Need a modern, high-performance web framework for the API gateway that supports async operations, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and type safety.

#### Decision
Use FastAPI as the primary web framework for the API gateway service.

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation
- Built-in request/response validation with Pydantic
- Excellent async support
- High performance (comparable to Node.js)
- Type safety with Python type hints

**Negative**:
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with FastAPI
- Less mature ecosystem compared to Django/Flask
- Potential vendor lock-in to FastAPI patterns

**Risks**:
- Framework limitations for complex use cases
- Community support and long-term maintenance

### ADR-0003: Next.js for Web Frontend

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-04  
**Decision Owner**: Application Architect

#### Context
Need a modern, performant frontend framework that supports server-side rendering, TypeScript, and excellent developer experience for the web application.

#### Decision
Use Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript for the web frontend.

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Server-side rendering for better SEO and performance
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Excellent developer experience with hot reloading
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Turbopack for fast builds

**Negative**:
- Framework complexity for simple applications
- Potential over-engineering for basic use cases
- Learning curve for React/Next.js patterns

**Risks**:
- Framework updates breaking changes
- Performance issues with large applications
- Bundle size concerns

### ADR-0004: PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-04  
**Decision Owner**: Application Architect

#### Context
The Quantum Platform requires strict multi-tenant data isolation. Need a database solution that can enforce tenant boundaries at the database level.

#### Decision
Use PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to enforce multi-tenant data isolation.

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Database-level tenant isolation
- Prevents data leakage between tenants
- Compliant with enterprise security requirements
- Leverages PostgreSQL's mature RLS implementation

**Negative**:
- Complex RLS policy management
- Potential performance impact on queries
- Requires careful policy testing and validation

**Risks**:
- RLS policy bugs causing data access issues
- Performance degradation with complex policies
- Migration complexity when changing policies

### ADR-0005: Azure as Primary Cloud Platform

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-04  
**Decision Owner**: Application Architect

#### Context
Need a cloud platform that provides enterprise-grade services, compliance certifications, and integration with Microsoft ecosystem.

#### Decision
Use Microsoft Azure as the primary cloud platform for hosting the Quantum Platform.

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- Integration with Microsoft ecosystem
- Comprehensive service offerings
- Strong support for containerized applications

**Negative**:
- Vendor lock-in to Azure services
- Potential higher costs compared to other providers
- Learning curve for Azure-specific services

**Risks**:
- Service availability and reliability
- Cost management and optimization
- Migration complexity if changing providers

## Decision Process

### How Decisions Are Made
1. **Identify Need**: Architectural decision required
2. **Gather Context**: Research options and constraints
3. **Evaluate Options**: Consider trade-offs and consequences
4. **Make Decision**: Document in ADR format
5. **Communicate**: Share with team and stakeholders
6. **Review**: Regular review and updates as needed

### Decision Owners
- **Application Architect**: Overall architecture and technology choices
- **Security Engineer**: Security-related decisions
- **SRE/Platform**: Infrastructure and operational decisions
- **Product Owner**: Business and feature decisions

### Review Process
- ADRs are reviewed quarterly
- Superseded ADRs are marked and archived
- New ADRs can be proposed by any team member
- All ADRs require approval from the Application Architect
