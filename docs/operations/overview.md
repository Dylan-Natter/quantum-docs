## 🚀 Deployment Procedures

### Deployment Strategy

#### Blue-Green Deployment
1. **Prepare Green Environment**
   - Deploy new version to green environment
   - Run health checks and smoke tests
   - Verify database migrations

2. **Switch Traffic**
   - Update load balancer to point to green
   - Monitor for 5 minutes
   - Verify metrics and error rates

3. **Cleanup**
   - Keep blue environment for 24 hours
   - Archive blue environment after verification

#### Canary Deployment
1. **Deploy to Canary**
   - Deploy to 5% of traffic
   - Monitor for 30 minutes
   - Check error rates and performance

2. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Increase to 25% if metrics are good
   - Monitor for 30 minutes
   - Increase to 50%, then 100%

3. **Rollback if Needed**
   - Automatic rollback on error rate increase
   - Manual rollback via deployment dashboard
