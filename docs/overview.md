## What is Quantum Platform?

Quantum Platform is a next-generation orchestration system designed for enterprise-scale deployment. Built on the principle of **intent-driven architecture**, it enables organizations to declare what they want to achieve rather than how to achieve it.

### Core Philosophy

> **"Declare intent, not implementation"**

Instead of writing procedural code, you define declarative intents that describe the desired state of your system. The platform then orchestrates the necessary actions to achieve that state.
